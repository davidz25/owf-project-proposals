# Project Name
Wallet Framework .NET (wallet-framework-dotnet)

# Project Description
The wallet-framework-dotnet is a framework designed for .NET, focusing on providing a multi-platform wallet framework. Initially a part of the Hyperledger Aries project (Aries Framework .NET), this initiative has now branched out to cater to a broader audience. The primary aim is to create a multiprotocol wallet framework enabling implementations of OpenID4VC and SD-JWT VC, in accordance to the European Identity Wallet initiative's objectives.

Currently, the framework supports DidComm v1 and AnonCreds. There is an active intention to extend support for other promising protocols, notably DidComm v2, to ensure the framework remains at the forefront of digital identity solutions.

Furthermore, the team is considering the development of SD-JWT credentials as a standalone library. This might transition into a separate project proposal in the future, underscoring the commitment to modular and reusable components in the digital identity space.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission
The wallet-framework-dotnet directly aligns with the OpenWallet Foundation mission by offering an open-source solution that will advance the state of digital identity wallets. The project's focus on implementing OpenID4VC in conjunction with the European Identity Wallet initiative underscores our commitment to global, interoperable standards, and enhances trust and security in digital identity systems.
